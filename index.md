# 👋 Hi, I'm Brian

I'm a cybersecurity student at Fox Valley Technical College, currently in my third semester and actively building hands-on skills in ethical hacking, troubleshooting, and command-line navigation. I've earned consistent Dean’s List honors and compete in the National Cyber League to sharpen my practical knowledge.

One of my greatest strengths is **communication and emotional intelligence** — qualities that bring a thoughtful perspective and a unique path to a technical career like cybersecurity. I approach challenges with curiosity, clarity, and a strong sense of integrity, and I’m committed to growing both technically and professionally.

I'm resourceful, driven, and currently seeking a general IT role where I can apply what I’ve learned and continue building toward a career in cybersecurity.
